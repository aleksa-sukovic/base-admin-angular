# Base Admin

'Base Admin' is foundation aimed to provide solid starting point for any project that requires CMS (content management system).

This project was done as an assignment task for my "Software Engineering" college course.

## Features

Main idea was to explore principles of modeling software to create an abstract base that could serve as starting point for many future projects that fit some predefined needs.

This is web project. It is separated into 2 main parts:
1. [Backend API](https://github.com/aleksa-sukovic/base-api-lumen).
2. Frontend Admin Panel (this repo).

Why separate projects into two distinct parts? Many reasons:
* Both parts can live on separate servers.
* Easier to maintain.
* Not bound to specific technologies (API implementation can change, as long as its endpoints remain the same).
* Ability to use API for other clients other that admin panel (websites, mobile apps).

This project was good example for showcasing common modeling techniques, especially those used in world of web applications.

## What have I learned

* A lot of software modeling techniques (more than I can list)* A lot of software modeling techniques (more than I can list).
