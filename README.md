# Base Admin

'Base Admin' is project aimed to provide solid starting point for any project that requires CMS (content management system)
This project was done as an assignment task for my "Software Engineering" college course.

## Features
****
Main idea was to explore principles of modeling software to create an abstract admin panel which could serve as starting point for future projects.

This is web project. It is separated into 2 main parts:
1. Backend API
2. Frontend Admin Panel (this repo)

Why separate projects into two distinct parts ? Many reasons:
* Both parts can live on separate servers
* Easier to maintain
* Not bound to specifici techologies (API implementation can change, as long as its endpoints remain the same)
* Ability to use API for other clients other that admin panel (websites, mobile apps)

This project was good example for showcasing commong modeling techniques, especially those used in world of web apps. 

## What have I learned
* A lot of software modeling techniques (more than I can list)
* Angular framework
* RxJS

## Where is the API
API was the most difficult part to build. I tought me a lot, lot more than admin panel project did.

Unfortunately, for now, I have to keep it in private repository since it is a part of another project.
